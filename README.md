# In-Class 2 - Recursion - Factorial and Towers of Hanoi

## Author



## Description

The purpose of this in-class is to get familiar with recursion. We will solve two problems in this one program.

The first problem will be a small example to solve Factorial using Recursion. This will demonstrate the basic concept of recursion and how it works.

The second problem will be a slightly larger one demonstrating how to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem. The main takeaway from this problem is that a recursive method can make multiple calls to itself in order to solve the problem.
